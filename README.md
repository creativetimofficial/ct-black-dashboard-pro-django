## Quick start

> UNZIP the sources or clone this repository. After getting the code, open a terminal and navigate to the working directory, with product source code.

<br />

> Export `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the environment. The value is provided during purchase. 

This is required because the project has a private REPO dependency: `github.com/app-generator/priv-django-admin-black-pro`

```bash
$ export GITHUB_TOKEN='TOKEN_HERE'  # for Linux, Mac
$ set GITHUB_TOKEN='TOKEN_HERE'     # Windows CMD
$ $env:GITHUB_TOKEN = 'TOKEN_HERE'  # Windows powerShell 
```

<br />

> ðŸ‘‰ Install modules via `VENV`.


```bash
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<br />

> ðŸ‘‰ Edit the `.env` using the template `.env.sample`. 

```env

# True for development, False for production
DEBUG=True

```

<br />

> ðŸ‘‰ Set Up Database

```bash
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
```

<br />

> ðŸ‘‰ Create the Superuser

```bash
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

<br />

> ðŸ‘‰ Start the app

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```

At this point, the app runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

< PROJECT ROOT >
   |
   |-- core/                            
   |    |-- settings.py                  # Project Configuration  
   |    |-- urls.py                      # Project Routing
   |
   |-- home/
   |    |-- views.py                     # APP Views 
   |    |-- urls.py                      # APP Routing
   |    |-- models.py                    # APP Models 
   |    |-- tests.py                     # Tests  
   |    |-- templates/                   # Theme Customisation 
   |         |-- includes                # 
   |              |-- custom-footer.py   # Custom Footer      
   |     
   |-- requirements.txt                  # Project Dependencies
   |
   |-- env.sample                        # ENV Configuration (default values)
   |-- manage.py                         # Start the app - Django default start script
   |
   |-- ************************************************************************
```

<br />

## How to Customize 

When a template file is loaded in the controller, `Django` scans all template directories starting from the ones defined by the user, and returns the first match or an error in case the template is not found. 
The theme used to style this starter provides the following files: 

```bash
< LIBRARY_ROOT >                     # This exists in ENV: LIB/admin_black_pro
   |
   |-- templates/                    # Root Templates Folder 
   |    |          
   |    |-- accounts/       
   |    |    |-- login.html          # Sign IN Page
   |    |    |-- register.html       # Sign UP Page
   |    |
   |    |-- includes/       
   |    |    |-- footer.html         # Footer component
   |    |    |-- sidebar.html        # Sidebar component
   |    |    |-- navigation.html     # Navigation Bar
   |    |    |-- scripts.html        # Scripts Component
   |    |
   |    |-- layouts/       
   |    |    |-- base.html           # Masterpage
   |    |    |-- base-auth.html      # Masterpage for Auth Pages
   |    |
   |    |-- pages/       
   |         |-- index.html          # Index Page (presentation)
   |         |-- settings.html       # Settings  Page
   |         |-- dashboard.html      # Dashboard page
   |         |-- *.html              # All other pages
   |    
   |-- ************************************************************************
```

When the project requires customization, we need to copy the original file that needs an update (from the virtual environment) and place it in the template folder using the same path. 

> For instance, if we want to **customize the footer.html** these are the steps:

- âœ… `Step 1`: create the `templates` DIRECTORY inside the `home` app
- âœ… `Step 2`: configure the project to use this new template directory
  - `core/settings.py` TEMPLATES section
- âœ… `Step 3`: copy the `footer.html` from the original location (inside your ENV) and save it to the `home/templates` DIR
  - Source PATH: `<YOUR_ENV>/LIB/admin_black_pro/includes/footer.html`
  - Destination PATH: `<PROJECT_ROOT>home/templates/includes/footer.html`

> To speed up all these steps, the **codebase is already configured** (`Steps 1, and 2`) and a `custom footer` can be found at this location:

`home/templates/includes/custom_footer.html` 

By default, this file is unused because the `theme` expects `footer.html` (without the `custom_` prefix). 

In order to use it, simply rename it to `footer.html`. Like this, the default version shipped in the library is ignored by Django. 

In a similar way, all other files and components can be customized easily.

<br />
