## Quick start

> UNZIP the sources or clone this repository. After getting the code, open a terminal and navigate to the working directory, with product source code.

<br />

> Export `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the environment. The value is provided during purchase. 

This is required because the project has a private REPO dependency: `github.com/app-generator/priv-django-admin-black-pro`

```bash
$ export GITHUB_TOKEN='TOKEN_HERE'  # for Linux, Mac
$ set GITHUB_TOKEN='TOKEN_HERE'     # Windows CMD
$ $env:GITHUB_TOKEN = 'TOKEN_HERE'  # Windows powerShell 
```

<br />

> ðŸ‘‰ Install modules via `VENV`.


```bash
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<br />

> ðŸ‘‰ Edit the `.env` using the template `.env.sample`. 

```env

# True for development, False for production
DEBUG=True

```

<br />

> ðŸ‘‰ Set Up Database

```bash
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
```

<br />

> ðŸ‘‰ Create the Superuser

```bash
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

<br />

> ðŸ‘‰ Start the app

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```

At this point, the app runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## File Structure

Within the download you'll find the following directories and files:

```bash
< PROJECT ROOT >
   |
   |-- core/                   # Implements app configuration
   |    |-- settings.py        # Defines Global Settings
   |    |-- wsgi.py            # Start the app in production
   |    |-- urls.py            # Define URLs served by all apps/nodes
   |
   |-- home/
   |    |
   |    |-- views.py           # Serve HTML pages for authenticated users
   |    |-- urls.py            # Define some super simple routes  
   |
   |
   |-- manage.py               # Start the app - Django default start script
   |-- requirements.txt        # Development modules - SQLite storage
   |
   |-- ************************************************************************
```

<br />

> The bootstrap flow

- Django bootstrapper `manage.py` uses `core/settings.py` as the main configuration file
- `core/settings.py` loads the app magic from `.env` file
- Redirect the guest users to Login page
- Unlock the pages served by *app* node for authenticated users
